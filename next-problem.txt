Your most important problem is the one infront of you


Rewrite the static components in the actor pool
to use the dynamic ComponentStore variable.

add these functions:
- register(Element size): adds a new component to the Component Store
	the store is at first completely empty
- Add(Element index, value)
- Remove(Element index)

still not sure whether Element index should always be the ID, or add
some other linking system

and then slowly transition to using these in the code
while rewriting the systems
